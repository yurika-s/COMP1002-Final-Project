# COMP1002-Final-Project
This repo is used for COMP1002 final project for group 5

## Final Project: The Retro Product Micro-site
### Description:
Believe it or not, there was a time before the internet, and they had products too! For this assignment, the idea is to select a product that existed before the internet (1993) and create a website for it.
Consider this project as if the company had dusted off the product and now wanted to market it on the web. The website should have a polished finish and be fully responsive.
This project must be done in a group of three (described and announced earlier on Blackboard). Groups will present their final project in class (6 minutes for each group). This work should be original and should not include libraries such as Bootstrap. Using a library will result in a zero for the project.
Instructions:
Please read and follow the instructions below carefully:
1. Do a quick search for a product before 1993, wiki would be a great place to look.
2. They may not have had a website but there should be some images and text content for you to collect to use on the website.
3. Arrange the content that you have gathered into 4 different pages.
  - The home page – This should contain a mixture of different media types and textual content, remember the home page will be the first page that a user interacts with, so it needs to grab the attention of the user.
  - About the company – The about page should contain content about the company. An about page is normally just an informational page that contains the company's story. The point of this page is to create trust between the user and the brand.
  - Product page – This page is straightforward. The purpose of this page is to display the product with the intent to sell the product. The content should be a mixture of images and text.
  - Contact page – The contact page should provide all the information needed to contact the company and it should also contain a contact form.
4. Construct 4 pages for the content. These pages should have all the proper metadata and valid HTML elements.
5. Create a global header and footer using JavaScript.
6. Use JavaScript to enhance the user experience.
7. Create an organized file hierarchy. This means files should be named appropriately and nested in the correct directories.
8. There should be no inline or embedded CSS. All CSS should be contained in its own file.
9. Comment your code.
10. Validate all HTML and CSS files.

### How to submit your project:
Group members will use GitHub for code collaboration (described below in the section "Steps for code collaboration on GitHub").
1. Make sure to validate your HTML and CSS files using the below tools:
- HTML: https://validator.w3.org/
- CSS: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
2. Group submission:
- Choose a representative (organizer) for your group; this person will create and manage a private GitHub repository for the final project's code collaboration, which will be shared with all members.
- The project repository contains project files and folders as well as a text file containing the project participants' information, named "team-members.txt", located in the root folder.
- The organizer will download the repository as a ZIP file and submit it to Blackboard. The other members of the group submit only the link to the shared repository on Blackboard.
* Submission and presentation due dates of final projects cannot be extended.
3 Steps for code collaboration on GitHub:
  1. Create a GitHub repository: One of the group members (organizer) should create a new private repository on GitHub named “COMP1002 Final Project”. Please ensure you have added “Dario-Hesami” as a collaborator for this new repository.
2. Add collaborators: The repository owner (organizer) adds the other two group members as collaborators.
3. Clone the repository: Each group member should clone the repository to their local machine.
4. Create branches: Each group member should create a new branch to work on a specific feature or task (e.g., “Home page”, “Product page”, “Main CSS”, “CSS for Contact page ”, “JS code”, “Website logo”, “Navigation”, and so on).
5. Make changes and commit: Each group member can make changes to the code, add files, and make commits to their local branch.
6. Push changes to GitHub: After making commits to their local branch, group members can push their branch to the GitHub repository.
7. Create pull requests: Once a group member has pushed their branch to the GitHub repository, they can create a pull request to merge their changes into the main branch of the repository. Other group members can review the changes and provide feedback.
8. Review and merge pull requests: The group can review each other's pull requests, discuss any changes that need to be made, and eventually merge the pull requests into the main branch of the repository (the repository owner can merge branches into the main branch. However, to allow other group members to merge branches, the owner should grant them the necessary permissions.
By following these steps, the group of three can effectively collaborate on their final project using GitHub.
### Web server:
After submitting the final project on Blackboard, change the repository visibility from private to public. Then, use the GitHub pages feature for deployment and publishing your website. Please note that you must do this step after the project submission due date - but not before that (after Wednesday, April 10th, at 11:59 p.m. and before the project presentation on Friday, April 12th).

### Evaluation:
You will receive 20% of your final grade for this assignment. The grade will be based on how well you followed the instructions from technical aspects, creativity, teamwork, and presentation.
The evaluation includes two parts:
1. Project code assessment (website must be published on the web using GitHub pages).
2. Teamwork (code collaboration) and presentation assessment (“Commit” pushed to the GitHub repository by group members will be checked).
